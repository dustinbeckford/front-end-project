# Front End Project 


This is the project I chose to present as my first Front-End Project for my Digital Crafts BootCamp class.

```
The app I've decided to produce is a Car Search engine. Here you will find specifications on any vehicle of your interest, by typing in a specific make, model and year. This is achieved by creating a function which uses our API to generate a fetch request to the API server. In return, the server displays an array of key value pairs in which we use DOM manipulation to append those elements to a div, allowing us to style them.

My goal of making this application is to provide the end-user with sufficient information on their vehicle of choice, this will equip the the user with enough information to complete an educated purchase.

I used an API called "Cars Api By Api Ninjas. Here is what to expect when inserting your specific parameters.



```


- Fuel Type
- Cylinders 
- Transmission *AUTO OR MANUAL*
- Min City Mpg
- Max City Mpg
- Min Hwy Mpg
- Max Hwy Mpg
- Min Combined MPG
- Max Combined MPG

```
The color scheme I've selected is white and gray to give a more modern feel to the web page, I've also used photos inserted in a carrousel to allow the user to scroll through photographs of vehicles. Upon entering the website, the user is greeted with 3 input fields for Make, Model and Year. After inserting the respected fields the user may click on the search button, this will great the user with the list of key value pairs in the array provided by my car api..
